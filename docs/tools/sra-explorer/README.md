# SRA-Explorer

Mini web application to explore the Sequence Read Archive and easily access
FTP download links for data.

This tool has the benefit of working out of the box, entirely in your browser
with no need for any back end setup. You can use it in two ways:

1. Directly on github: http://ewels.github.io/sra-explorer/
2. Download the `index.html` file and load in your web browser.

All the code relating to the SRA API calls are taken from
[Labrador](https://github.com/ewels/labrador). The page is built using
the [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com) CSS framework and all of the interaction
magic happens using [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org). The copy to clipboard
buttons are powered by [Clipboard.js](https://clipboardjs.com/).
